Whats new in 0.0.2
------------------

* Fixed bugs in python completion
* Added ability to use external python packages for completion.
* added documentation support by hovering
* added import support

- This would require adding the default python path to Preference.sublime-settings

	"intellekt": {
		// Change path as required.
		"python_path": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Python37-32"
	},
	"auto_complete_triggers": [ 
		{"selector": "source.python", "characters": "."}
	],
